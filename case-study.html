            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    This case study focuses on the design of a food truck on Drexel University's campus -- Lennox Got Lunch. 
                    The original design lacked brand uniqueness and engaging interactions. As the front-end developer, I aimed
                    to enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive features that would make the food truck more
                    appealing to students and faculty. The redesign focused on creating a more engaging and interactive experience
                    for users, encouraging them to explore the food truck's menu and offerings. With my design, users will experience
                    memorable animations and dynamic hover states that enhance functionality and provide easy navigation.

        <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>
                    My final project for IDM216 focuses on designing a mobile friendly application for a food truck of our choosing from 
                    IDM215 called Lennox Got Lunch. Conducted as a group effort, the project was part of the User Experience Design II 
                    class taught by Professor Paul Phan. There were a total of 5 team members. My primary position was the front-end developer and 
                    secondarily the Project Management role. Over the course of 10 weeks, six assignments helped in the production 
                    of my final project:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://idm216-lennox-website.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Web Page</li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/mjc498/idm216-lennox-app" target="_blank">Team Repo and Collaboration</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://idm216-lennox-website.vercel.app/assets.html" target="_blank">Project Web Page</a></li>
                        <li>Alpha - Build</li>
                        <li>Beta - Build</li>
                        <li>Final - Build</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    The project operated on a zero-cost budget, aligning with its goal to provide students like myself hands-on experience with 
                    modern design theories and front-end scripting languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JS. This project also fulfilled the class's 
                    learning objectives by focusing on the creation of fully functioning web applications via a full production pipeline. 
                    Throughout this course, I also made sure to incorporate User Design practices along the way of front-end development.
                </p>
        
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Lennox Got Lunch is a food truck located on Drexel University's campus. The truck lacked a proper brand identity and
                    engaging interactions that would make it more appealing to students and faculty. There was nothing to base this project
                    on except for the <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/team/1240741858362641420/project/322894976/IDM216-Lennox?fuid=1289367730452544438" 
                    target="_blank">Figma Design</a> that was created in IDM215. With designs fully created on Figma, it was my duty to bring
                    these designs to life through code.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Goals & Objectives</h4>
                <p>
                    I approached the Lennox Got Lunch food truck app with a focus on maintaining a legible and clean codebase. It was important that 
                    the code remained accessible and well-organized for my teammates and even the professor to understand. Another key objective was 
                    ensuring my teammates were consistently aware of the content being committed via GitHub. Over the course of 10 weeks, I was responsible
                    for hard-coding design assets, components, animations, interactions, and other elements created in Figma. Given the vast amount of 
                    content, I stayed on top of my goals and objectives to maintain clear and consistent communication, especially with the back-end 
                    developer, while also ensuring legibility and organization in my code.

            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                <p>
                    The app was designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all users. It was also built to be responsive on all devices, including 
                    desktop, tablet, and mobile. We aimed to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that all users could 
                    navigate the app with ease. Users of food delivery or food-related applications can be just about anyone. Whether someone is 
                    looking for convenience in distance or time or simply wants to try a new place, the Lennox Got Lunch app caters to all users.

<!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4><a href="https://idm241-mjc498.netlify.app/final-build" target="_blank">Link to Final Build</a></h4>
            <h4>Order Status Animations</h4>
                <p>
                    For my first code-based animation, I wanted something that visually shows users that their order was being placed,
                    prepared, readied, and completed. The animation starts as soon as the page loads so that <strong>DOMContentLoaded</strong> 
                    could prepare elements before executing JavaScript. Key elements are then selected, including the order status steps 
                    <strong>(.order-status-item)</strong>, the progress line <strong>(.order-status-line)</strong>, and other text that updates as the 
                    order moves through each stage. I also store an array of “active” icons to visually indicate progression -- black and white icons
                    smoothly fading into red and black colors. Lastly, After 5 seconds, the "Order In Progress" text changes to "Order Complete" 
                    to confirm the final state.
                </p>         
                <div class="final-gif"><img src="images/order-status-animation.gif" alt="gif 1 of order status animation container"></div>

            <h4>Modal Animations</h4>
                <p>
                    I set up two different modals throughout the Checkout Flow: one for choosing a payment method and another for adding a new card. The 
                    payment method modal opens when the user clicks the small arrow next to the payment section. When clicked, it triggers a function that 
                    makes the modal appear while smoothly dimming the overlay. Inside this modal, users can see their current payment method and choose 
                    between Apple Pay, Venmo, or "Add a New Card".
                </p>
                <div class="final-gif"><img src="images/modal-animations.gif" alt="gif 2 of modal animated container"></div>

                <p>
                    The second modal appears when the user selects "Add a New Card" within the first modal. Instead of just closing the first modal and opening 
                    the second as a separate task, I made it more natural by transitioning from one modal to another. If the user changes their mind, they can 
                    click the back arrow, which brings them back to the payment selection screen. I focused on making these modals intuitive so users can select a
                    payment method with ease.
                </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, this 10-week project was a success. I met the necessary requirements to achieve my Final Build as the front-end
                    developer. I coded and developed a fully functioning moble app that could be ready for the next stop of production.  
                    Each page shows simple experiences that is straightforward, but also memorable, for users to remember and continue using.
                    Presenting various phases of the project to my professor and classmates in the IDM216 course was invaluable for gathering 
                    constructive feedback and critiques.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this project, I developed better time management skills and understood the significance of deadlines on a professional level. 
                    All of my design decisions were made with careful consideration of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). For example, 
                    I ensured that all the button texts passed the color testto enhance readability for all users. It also taught me a lot of patience 
                    with different people who have unique skill sets and attitudes toward approaching a project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflecting on this 10-week process, I realize it could have been more efficient if I had consistently documented and tracked the feedback I received. 
                    This would have allowed me to better evaluate my progress from the beginning of the project to its completion. There was a lot of 
                    miscommunication that could have been avoided if every role on the team updated each other to understand what needs to be done or fixed. 
                    Additionally, I should have separated each design build (Alpha, Beta, Final) into three separate branches to avoid any confusion or even just 
                    created separate html files for each build. This would have made it easier to track the progress of each build and to see the changes made
                    from one build to the next.
